🛒 ShopX – Django Ecommerce Website (Server-Side Rendered)

ShopX is a full-featured ecommerce web application built using Django.
It provides a complete shopping experience with product browsing, cart management, checkout, order history, and a dedicated admin dashboard for managing products and users.

This project demonstrates real-world ecommerce logic, backend workflows, and Django best practices, using server-side rendered templates.

🧠 Core Logic Highlights

Session-based authentication & role handling

Session-based cart system with stock validation

Order & OrderItem separation for clean order management

Context processor for global auth access, cart count, and recent orders

Cloudinary integration for product images

Clear separation of concerns:

Models → data

Views → backend logic

Templates → UI

⚠️ Frontend is rendered via Django templates; JavaScript is minimal or not used. All filtering, sorting, and cart operations are handled server-side.
